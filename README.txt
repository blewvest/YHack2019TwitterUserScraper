In order to properly run this python web scraper, you should run it through idle. Be sure to import all the python modules we used to ensure it runs correctly. We attempted to deploy this as a website for easier access through Google Cloud Services but failed in doing so.

The purpose of this web scraper is outlined in the pdf included with this README. 

This program incorporates the database aspects of the Google Cloud services. Related tweets are stored in a Firebase Firestore database for easy readibility.

Thank you for your time.
